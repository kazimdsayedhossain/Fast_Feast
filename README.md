This is the menu option. Currently it does not require any input of customer data. After 
processing the order, the total ammount will be passed to a function called make_payment()
and send the total ammount to pay as argument of it. Make sure that this function is availble
in the payment class and accessable. I request you to be careful when making any input.
Follow the input instructions,
1. Don't input character or any other thing other when asked for any numarical value.
2. Please don't input any unaccepted character at any phase.
3. When asked for numarical value or a character you should only input the instructed character
   or number.
You can contact me if you need any further clarification. Thank you.
Don't make any changes to the existing code, if you need to add any function or class
please contact me first. Thank you.
